# ⚡ Eco Riders – Piezoelectric Road Power Generation

## 🌍 About the Project
Eco Riders is a student innovation that turns busy roads into a source of clean energy. Using **piezoelectric sensors**, the system captures the pressure created by moving vehicles and converts it into **electricity**. This energy can power **streetlights, traffic signals, and smart city utilities** sustainably. 🌱

---

## 🚗 How It Works
1. Install piezoelectric sensors beneath road surfaces.  
2. When vehicles pass, the pressure is converted into electrical energy.  
3. The generated electricity is stored or directly used for public utilities.

## 🌱 Why It Matters
- Reduces dependency on traditional power sources  
- Promotes sustainable smart city development  
- Uses existing road infrastructure with minimal changes  
- 100% eco-friendly, zero emissions
